  Finally the code is open for the six-pack requirement (not he factory, but the
rest is!). By updating the tests and running them the following error comes up:

  -Take one down and pass it around, 1 six-pack of beer on the wall.
  +Take one down and pass it around, 6 bottles of beer on the wall.

  -1 six-pack of beer on the wall, 1 six-pack of beer.
  +6 bottles of beer on the wall, 6 bottles of beer.

  The code is returning 6 when it should return 1, that is quantity. Instead of
six-pack it is returning bottles, that is container concept.

  1. Create a new class BottleNumber6 with the varying differences
  2. Update the factory
